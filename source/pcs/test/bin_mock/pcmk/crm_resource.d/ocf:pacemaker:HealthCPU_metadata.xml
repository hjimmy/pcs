<!--
     The original agent defines red_limit with unique=1.
     However, we use this agent to test the 'pcs resource describe' command and
     its ability to mark unique attributes as such. In order to have at least
     one unique and one non-unique attribute for the test, red_limit has been
     made non-unique.
     If this is needed to be set to unique for whatever reason, create a new
     agent XML to use in the describe test. Perhaps it would be better if it
     wasn't based on any existing agent and would be named e.g.
     ocf:pacemaker:pcs-test-describe.
